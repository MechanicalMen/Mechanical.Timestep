Mechanical.Timestep
===================

What it is
----------
This is just something I wrote for fun, after reading an interesting article ([Fix your timestep](https://gafferongames.com/post/fix_your_timestep/)). I think this can be a good excercise for beginner programmers, and encourage you to try to implement the ideas yourself, before taking a look at the code.
